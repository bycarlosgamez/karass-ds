An Accordion displays collapsible content panels for presenting information in
a limited space. Use it to group related content that users can expand or
collapse as needed.

## ðŸŽ¤ Description

Accordions are interactive UI elements used to toggle the visibility of related content. Perfect for FAQs, expandable lists, and settings panels, they organize content into discrete, collapsible blocks.

This Accordion system is composed of modular elements that offer high customizability:

- **Accordion**: The root container managing all toggling behavior.
- **AccordionItem**: Encapsulates a single expandable section.
- **AccordionHeader**: The trigger that expands or collapses its associated content.
- **AccordionContent**: Holds the detailed content shown when open.

You can use multiple `AccordionItem` blocks for independent toggling, or control them via props for single-section behavior. Custom styles, icons, and transitions can be layered in to tailor the UX for your application.
